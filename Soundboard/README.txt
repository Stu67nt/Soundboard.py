Hi. It's a surprise you downloaded this. Anyways you can feel free to do whatever you want with this.
As of writing I have no clue whether this will work, and you may have to modify the code to get it to work.
If you have this I was able to get it working on my IDE or you hacked my computer. No I don't have any bitcoin for you.
You will probably have to configure a few things such as the folder location and setting files for each of the buttons.
This can be done through the options button when running the program.
