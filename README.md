Prerequisites:
    
    Python 3.12 i think
    Pygame
    Other modules should be python native to my knowledge.

To run download the soundboard folder and run soundboard.py. All the settings will need configuring when you first open the program. This can be done in the options menu. I have no clue if this will actually run on other peoples computers but i ran on mine in testing. There aren't any bad crashes only some ones which occour whenthe user wants to close the program so I cba to fix those.

Future plans I have for this are

    Push audio through microphone so you can troll friends and stuff without the audio quality being messed up.
    Make it an exe file where the user does't need to set up to make the program run.
    Pre configure as much as possible.

Let me know how bad my code is.
